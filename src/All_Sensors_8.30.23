bme680_bsec:
    # id
    # -----------
    # Identifier for this component, useful when working with multiple devices.
    # Must be unique, and can be used in the sensor sections to refer to the correct device.
    # Default: auto-computed
    id: bme680_internal

    # i2c address
    # -----------
    # Common values are:
    # - 0x76
    # - 0x77
    # Default: 0x76
    address: 0x77

    # Temperature offset
    # ------------------
    # Useful if device is in enclosure and reads too high
    # For example, if it reads 5C too high, set this to 5
    # This also corrects the relative humidity readings
    # Default: 0
    temperature_offset: 0

    # IAQ calculation mode
    # --------------------
    # Available options:
    # - static (for fixed position devices)
    # - mobile (for on a person or other moveable devices)
    # Default: static
    iaq_mode: static

    # Sample rate
    # -----------
    # Available options:
    # - lp (low power - samples every 3 seconds)
    # - ulp (ultra-low power - samples every 5 minutes)
    # Default: lp
    sample_rate: ulp

    # Interval at which to save BSEC state
    # ------------------------------------
    # Default: 6h
    state_save_interval: 6h
